Tiny-moulinette is a test runner designed to pre-test the 42 C Piscine assignments, aiming to provide automatic testing for all assignments with a single command. Our ultimate goal is to generate and verify all test cases for every C Piscine assignment.

## Introduction
You're probably doing your best in the C Piscine course. During this program, peer evaluations offer a great opportunity to learn, but this process may lead to some wasted time. If you can't avoid stupid mistakes, such as failing to pass the ***norminette***, you'll waste valuable time. This is why we started this projectâ€”to pass the moulinette in a single submission.
